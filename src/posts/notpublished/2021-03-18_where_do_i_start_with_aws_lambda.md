# Where do I start with AWS Lambda?

When I first began looking at the possibility of using Aws lAmbda for a new project, I was lost as to where I should start. How do I version control? How should I deploy and group functions? Use aws console or cloudformation? Lambda per endpoint or grouped together?

These questions made it difficult to even begin.

- Start small - group into single proxy lambda
- Use infrastructure as code
