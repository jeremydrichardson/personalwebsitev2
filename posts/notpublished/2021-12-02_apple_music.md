Managing an Apple Music library can be a pain in the ass if you have multiple devices, users, servers, etc... I've tried a bunch of things and here is what I've found.

## Don't Store Apple Music library file anywhere other than it's default location

The issue is that macOS keeps that file open all the time so you can never eject the disk that it is on until you logout or shutdown the operating system. You can store the media on an external drive but don't store the music library file on an external drive.
