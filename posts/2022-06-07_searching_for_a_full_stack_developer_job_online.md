I’ve recently begun to look for new work. I haven’t had to do this specific type of job search in a long time since my last number of positions were through professional relationships. I pursued all of these career connections I had first, as that’s usually the best way to land a position , but there are now so many resources for finding work that it can be overwhelming. I thought I’d explain my process to help anyone in the same position.

## Professional Connections

First and foremost, _let all your professional connections know you’re looking for work_. Past co-workers, friends, neighbors—whoever you know that is in the tech industry, just let them know one way or another that you’re looking for work.

I would prioritize in person meetings if you can. It goes a long way to be able to just sit down and have a conversation with someone about your career and thoughts about your future, even if it’s just for your confidence level as you search for a job.

Then, LinkedIn, Facebook, text messages are all good way to make that quick little touch. Sometimes in the past I would hesitate reaching out to someone, thinking that the only time I talk to them is when I need something. Then I started to look at it in a positive light&mdash;maybe this is the perfect topic to reconnect and reestablish that relationship.

## Job Sites

### LinkedIn

The next place I continue my search is [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com). Make sure all your profile information is up to date with at least your work experience and education. It’s helpful, but not essential (in my opinion), to find people who might add a recommendation for you. The main thing is to get something up there that you feel represents you. You should consistently be adding to and revising your profile, but don’t wait until your have the _perfect profile_ to get started. You gotta get in motion.

Once you have your basic LinkedIn profile ready, you will use that information to fill out all other job posting sites that you deem to be useful. Make sure to turn on the setting that you’re _Open to Work_ and only to show recruiters if you don’t want your current employer to know you’re looking.

### Indeed

I found [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com) to be more focused on just listing jobs than LinkedIn’s social media approach. It was far easier to find relevant job postings using Indeed than LinkedIn. You can browse jobs whenever you have a minute and always favorite them if you don’t have time to apply that minute.

Setup your profile with your information from LinkedIn. Never rewrite stuff if you don’t need to.

Similar to LinkedIn, Indeed has a _Ready to work_ setting that you’ll want to turn on.

### Glassdoor

Although [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) is actually owned by Indeed, I found it offered value on it’s own. It could help you get a feel for a company based on reviews employees have left. You always have to take them with a grain of salt, but it is helpful. Glassdoor also posts estimated salary expectations even if the job posting does not explicitly state. I’m not sure how accurate the estimates are but it still helps.

Complete using the same principles as the other networks, enter your profile information and turn on the setting that tells everyone you’re ready to work.

### State Sponsored Job Board

You should look at your local government’s job search options. Often they will have their own system that provides listings. I’m in Iowa and we have [IowaWORKS](https://iowaworks.gov). Can’t say it’s the best user experience but I have found some opportunities through their listings.

You may need to apply for jobs through this state sponsored job as well if you’re applying for unemployment. In Iowa we are required to prove we’ve applied to at least 3 jobs each week to qualify for unemployment. The way to track this is through the IowaWORKS website.

### Others

There are so many out there. I have tried a few others but honestly there is enough in the above recommendations to keep you busy for a long time.

## Cover Letter

I can’t emphasize enough—the cover letter matters. Yes, these jobs sites make it super easy to apply and you could just go for numbers and apply all over the place. However, remember that it’s just as easy for all those other applicants as well.

_Your cover letter will help you stand out_.

Find a formula that you can use as the basis for every application and then customize per job. I know it’s work, but your cover letter will help you stand out in the crowd. It’s like you’re elevator pitch. You need to prove to the recruiter that you are the best candidate for the job in less than a page.

### Cover letter formula

I’ll share with you my secret sauce of how I write cover letters. I’m sure there are better ways out there but this has worked for me.

#### Three quotes from the job posting

This proves that you thoroughly read the posting and are highlighting to the recruiter specific ways that you fit this job description.

Find things that both excite you about this position and that match your skills.

Here is an example:

> collaborate and mentor international teammates

#### First paragraph

Start by summarizing your resume in a single paragraph. Maybe talk about a specific project you worked on or the technologies you specialize in. This is the only time in your resume you are going to talk about your accomplishments. The rest is going to focus on the needs of the employer and how you meet those.

#### Following three paragraphs

The next three paragraphs you will give evidence of how you are a match for this job based on the three quotes you highlight at the top.

Here is an example I have used that answers the example quote above:

> In my current position I have mentored four junior developers—3 of which were from Brazil—on how to build applications with full-stack tools. Basecamp, which specializes in asynchronous collaboration, was used for day to day with regular teaching sessions by Zoom. I documented everything in a way that could be picked up by any one of those developers if I was unavailable.

I’m giving the evidence of how my experience fulfills exactly what they are looking for.

#### Closing sentence

I close the cover letter by saying that I think I would be an asset to their team and would love a chance to show them why.

## Tracking the status of your search

Very quickly you will find it difficult to remember the status of any one of your applications. Did I apply already? Have I had one interview or two so far? Did they even answer me yet?

### Notion databases

You can use anything to track your progress, but I found Notion to be an asset in this regard. Notion allowed me to list all jobs in a table. Then, for situations where I applied to multiple jobs, I had a separate table for the company list with a relationship to the jobs list.

I also have a kanban board view for the job list so that I can see the status of each with the classic kanban style columns. The further to the right, the closer I am to getting an offer.

#### Job Postings table

I used the following fields but this is just to get your started. Add whatever information you want to track.

- Job Title
- Company Name - this is a relationship to the _Job Companies_ database
- Job posting link - I also add the job description to the body of the Notion page in case the job posting goes away at some point
- Status - I use these basic status’ to know where I am in the process and to define the kanban board columns
  - Applied
  - 1st Interview
  - 2nd Interview
  - 3rd Interview
  - 4th Interview (yes, sometimes there is a 4th…)
  - Offer made
  - No match - when you or the company decide to go different directions
- Status notes - sometime reality doesn’t fit into those specific categories, use this to explain where things are at
- Apply date
- 1st interview date
- 2nd interview date
- 3rd interview date
- 4th interview date

#### Job Companies

- Name
- Website - I usually link to the careers page
- Contact name - usually recruiter or HR
- Address - applicable if you’re looking at local on-premises work

I’m sure there is more you could track on the company. I try not to complicate it too much for no reason. Most info on a company I can easily and quickly find from their website or a Google search.

## Conclusion

I don’t know that this is the perfect formula, but it’s the one I have used fairly successfully in the past and will continue to evolve in the future. Online tools make this process more fun but can be overwhelming. Creating a system will help you simplify and focus on the jobs instead of the process.

## Appendix

### Unemployment

It sucks to be out of work and it’s usually not a quick process to get hired. Depending on where you live there may be financial help to get you by.

Find out the options and requirements in your area. Many times it is linked to your job search so it is best to find out early so you can modify your system to take any requirements into account.

For instance, in Iowa you are required to apply to at least 3 jobs each week and log them in their system. I modified my system to track all the information they were looking for to qualify for unemployment.
