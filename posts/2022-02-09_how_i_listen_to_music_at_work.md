Working from home has opened up my listening possibilities as I don’t have to worry about paying attention to close by co-workers or clients and don’t have to wear Air-pods all day which can become quite uncomfortable.

I have found myself using the following methods and stations to shake up my routine.

## Amazon Music

Our family pays for an Amazon Prime subscription which includes the basic Amazon Music service (not to be confused with Amazon Music Unlimited which is more directly analogous to Apple Music or Spotify).

### Saved Music

I still buy CDs (discussed [elsewhere in this blog](https://www.notion.so/How-to-sync-Apple-Music-library-with-Plex-f33ea48b7f38455cb0886c028fc2cf58)). Most of my purchases are from Amazon. Some titles include their AutoRip feature where it is automatically added to your Amazon Music app.

You can also search for other albums and singles that are available and save them to My Library.

- **Random track listen** - This will randomly pull songs from my library and play them. Great when I’m not sure what to listen to. Often will trigger me putting on a specific album or artist.

### Stations

- **Lo-fi Hip-hop** - Great for times when I really need to focus. Mostly instrumental with a calm and grooving vibe.
- **Thievery Corporation** - Another primarily instrumental station that works great for background music.

## Plex

This is where I store my entire ripped CD collection for playback at home or saving to my device for remote playback.

### Stations

- **Random Album Radio** - This has been my favorite lately. Instead of just pulling random tracks from my library, it will pull a random album and play the entire track list. Then automatically move on to the next. I’m generally an album listener so this suits me well.
