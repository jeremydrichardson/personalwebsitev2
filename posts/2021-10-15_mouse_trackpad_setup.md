# Mouse/Trackpad setup

I recently began having some issues with my right wrist. It was getting sore making it extremely uncomfortable to work at my computer.

It seemed the source of the issue came from the motion used with my trackpad. I had dealt with similar issues when working in Photoshop and other fine motor skill activities, but never to this degree.

The first step was to stay away from my computer for a bit. Took a weekend where I didn't even touch it and that definitely helped.

The second step was to pull out an old Dell wired mouse. The reason I switched to the tackpad was I really love the gestures that come inherent with macOS and didn't want to lose that moving back to a mouse.

My solutions was to move the trackpad to my left hand and use the mouse with my right hand. It has been a great solution and really the best of both worlds. My right wrist is far less stressed and I still get the benefits of the trackpad gestures on my left.

In fact, I would venture to say that this is actually a superior setup. I can't pin down exactly why it's better but just the fact that I'm using both hands instead of just one seems like a win.

Of course, I love sticking to the keyboard as well. Gotta learn as many shortcuts as possible to be fast.
