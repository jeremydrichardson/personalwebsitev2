Recently purchased a pair of 6 outlet power strips to mount under my desk to improve the cable management situation. It was instigated by getting a great Black Friday deal on an APC UPS battery backup.

## Mounting

I mounted them using some 3M command strips that were actually part of another kit I had hanging around. Used 4 strips for each powerbar to hopefully get a good hold. If they don’t work I’ll screw the power bars in but thought I’d give it a try.

I mounted one offset on each side of the desk right at the deepest edge. This gives me wide access to power and versatility in how to manage the cables.

I used the same command hooks that the strips came from to hold the power cable up and out of the way. Not sure they will end up working great but maybe it will be a temporary solution until I find something better.

## Desk setup

I’ll post some more photos and descriptions once I complete the setup. Waiting on a Mac Mini under desk mount that I’m excited about to hide much of the cable madness. I like a clean desk.

The key was getting power strips that don’t have surge protection. I will be plugging these into an APC UPS power supply which specifically warns against plugging surge protectors into it. The tl;dr is that the surge protection can mask the load and give the UPS an incorrect reading which could lead to overloads.
